# lol-tracker

League Tracker is a League of legends account tracker, just enter a player's nickname to retrieve their Puuid, then a search by Puuid is possible, this is useful when the player has changed their nickname.

This project was asked by a coach friend of mine who wanted to be able to easily find his players when they change their nickname.
